# Express Crash Course — My Learning Journey

This repository contains my hands-on practice, notes, and mini-projects as I learn Express.js through the Express Crash Course by Traversy Media (Brad Traversy), along with my own extended learning. My goal is to build a strong backend foundation so I can confidently develop full-stack applications and become job-ready as a React developer by April 2026.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Why I Am Learning Express
I am currently building an e-commerce application. To do that well, I need to understand routing, middleware, REST API design, authentication, databases, and backend security. This repository is my practice space.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

What I Will Learn
- Express fundamentals
- Routing and middleware
- REST API structure
- Working with MongoDB and Mongoose
- Authentication using JWT
- Password hashing
- Environment variables and configuration
- Security best practices
- Error handling
- Deploying Express applications

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mini Projects I Will Build
1. Notes API (CRUD, routes, middleware)
2. Authentication API (register, login, JWT, password hashing)
3. Tasks API (CRUD with MongoDB and validation)
4. E-commerce Backend (users, products, categories, cart, orders, admin role)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/ALEXKOCHENS/Express-Crash-course.git

2. Install dependencies:
   npm install

3. Create a .env file with values such as:
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your_database_connection
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key

4. Start the development server:
   npm run dev

My Learning Roadmap
December 2025: Express basics, routing, middleware, REST
January 2026: MongoDB, Mongoose, authentication
February 2026: E-commerce backend structure
March 2026: Testing and deployment
April 2026: Connect Express backend with React front-end, portfolio preparation

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Final Note
This repository documents my complete learning journey with Express. Each commit represents progress toward mastering backend development and preparing for real-world full-stack work.
